Step 1
In this workshop, you will practice styling checkboxes by building a game settings panel.

All of the HTML boilerplate (DOCTYPE, html, head and body) has been provided for you.

Within the body, create a div element with an h1 element nested inside. Give the h1 element the text Game Settings

Step 2
Immediately after your h1 element, create four label elements.

Inside of each of the label elements, create an input element with the type attribute set to "checkbox".

After each input element, give your label elements the following texts, in order: Sound Effects, Background Music, Hard Mode, and Haptic Feedback.

Step 3
Now you will begin sprucing the page up with some CSS styling. Begin by creating the body selector.

Set the body to have a height property with a value of 100vh and a background-color property with a value of #f0f0f0.

The height of 100vh makes the body take up the full height of the browser viewport, while the light gray background color provides a subtle base for the page.

Lastly, set a text-align property with the value of center. This will center all inline-content contained within the page unless a child element overrides it with its own alignment.
